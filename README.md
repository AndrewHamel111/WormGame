# WormGame
WormGame, originally a failed Game Jam project is being rebuilt for WebGL in Unity.
## The Gist / Jist / Basics
In a graphical style not dissimilar to Paper Mario, (where the environment consists of a mix between 3D primitives and sprites displayed at an angle,) a casual puzzle game follows the adventure of a single worm. Clark (the worm) is crawling along the ground when he tumbles into a man of glass with a water jug for a head. Suddenly, Clark can walk around and explore the forest. He is quickly reunited with other worms, and makes it his quest to bring the rest of his buddies together.

## The Problem
This was only my second shot at a Game Jam, and I didn't quite have enough experience with Unity. My first Game Jam submission was a failure because I did not give myself a chance to practice deploying a GMS project ahead of time and I hit a presumably unsolvable error within 20 minutes of the submission time and although I submitted a build, it was not playable.

I saw this Game Jam as a fresh start, and since it was a week as opposed to only a weekend I thought we would do a lot better. Unfortunately, I overextended myself with two artists and put making their art visible in the game above developing an actual game. What I was left with was a kinda neat looking walking simulator with no levels, weak mechanics and bad UI / Dialogue.
## The Purpose
The purpose of this project is to put all the great art my friends Cedric and Jaylen made for me to good use. It's a project with plenty of still usable code, and it'll give me a chance to practice rescuing scripts from a sinking ship.
